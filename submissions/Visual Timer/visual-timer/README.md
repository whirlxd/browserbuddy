## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Click the Visual Timer icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the settings popup
2. The extension is enabled by default with a 2-hour timer
3. The overlay will start blue and gradually transition through green and purple to red when the set time is reached

### Settings

#### Timer Controls
- **Enable Visual Timer**: Toggle the overlay on/off for all websites
- **Show Time Display**: Toggle the visibility of the time counter
- **Time Until Red**: Set the total duration before the overlay turns red
  - Hours: 0-24
  - Minutes: 0-59
- **Overlay Opacity**: Adjust the transparency of the color overlay (1-100%)
  - Lower values make the overlay more transparent
  - Higher values make the overlay more visible
  - Default: 70%

#### Control Buttons
- **Reset Timer**: Restart the timer from 0 and reset the color to blue
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily stop/start the timer

### Color Stages

The overlay transitions through four distinct colors:
1. Blue (Start)
2. Green (33% of set time)
3. Purple (66% of set time)
4. Red (100% of set time)

### YouTube Compatibility

When using YouTube, the extension automatically adjusts its overlay to:
- Keep video controls accessible
- Maintain video player visibility
- Use a screen blend mode for better color visibility

## Tips

- Use the time display toggle to reduce distractions while keeping the color indicator
- Reset the timer when starting a new task
- Pause the timer during breaks
- The extension automatically pauses when your system is idle
- The settings are synchronized across your Chrome profile
- The overlay works independently on each tab
- Use the opacity slider to find the perfect balance between visibility and non-intrusiveness
- Your opacity settings will sync across all your Chrome instances
- Find your ideal opacity setting based on your screen brightness and website colors
- On dark websites, you might want to use lower opacity values
- On light websites, higher opacity values might work better
- Save different opacity settings for different times of day

## Technical Details

- Built with vanilla JavaScript
- Uses Chrome Extension Manifest V3
- Utilizes Chrome's storage, alarms, idle, and tabs APIs
- Lightweight with minimal performance impact

## Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:
- `storage`: Save your settings and timer state
- `alarms`: Update the timer every second
- `idle`: Detect system idle state
- `tabs`: Apply the overlay to web pages

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Timer Not Appearing or Extension not working**
   - Try toggling the "Enable Visual Timer" switch off and on again
   - Refresh the webpage you're trying to use the timer on
   - Make sure you've granted all necessary permissions

2. **Time Display Not Showing**
   - Toggle the "Show Time Display" switch off and then on
   - Check if "Enable Visual Timer" is turned on, as the time display requires the timer to be enabled

3. **Settings Not Syncing**
   - Make sure you're signed into your browser
   - Try closing and reopening your browser
   - Check if you have sync enabled in your browser settings
