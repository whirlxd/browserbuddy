# remindme
remindme is [my](github.com/arsoninstigator/readme) first attempt at building a chrome extension for hack club's <b>browser buddy</b> ysws.

## concept
i came up with this project idea pretty quickly since it was based on my own experience applying to colleges and scholarships this fall. this extension solves a specific problem that is kind of a big deal for me — i come across a lot of scholarships i'm eligible for that only open their applications in the future and have strict deadlines. so, im supposed to take a mental note of when to expect to apply for the specific scholarship and keep them all in my mind on written in a notebook, but the problem is that you can't go through a list of scholarship deadlines everyday to scour for ones that are upcoming to act as a mental reminder (because that would make me go insane), so this extension does this work for me!

## demo
you can see this demonstration of adding a website to the extension [here](https://github.com/arsoninstigator/remindme/blob/main/demo/browserbuddy-demo.mp4)
