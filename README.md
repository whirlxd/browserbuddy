# BrowserBuddy Grant Program

BrowserBuddy, by Hack Club, supports teenagers in building and publishing their own browser extensions. Participants receive a $30 grant, which includes a $5 Chrome Developer License and $25 for additional prizes, to launch their extensions to the Chrome Web Store.

## How It Works

1. **Brainstorm**: Think of a unique idea for an extension.
2. **Develop & Test**: Build and test your extension with at least 10 users.
3. **Submit & Publish**: Submit your project by October 31st, and get your extension live on Chrome and Firefox.

## Requirements

- Unique, problem-solving extensions.
- Open-source code.
- Compatible with Chrome-based and Firefox browsers.
