# High Seas Doubloons Extension

This project is a browser extension that enhances the experience on the [Hack Club High Seas Shipyard](https://highseas.hackclub.com/shipyard) website by adding useful features and visual updates.


## Why I Made This Project

Each time I ship a project, I find myself wondering how much people voted for me and how many Doubloons I earned per hour.
This led me to manually calculate these values every time I ship a project,
which was time-consuming and repetitive.

To solve this problem, I created this extension to automate the calculations and provide the information at a glance. 
Now, I can focus more on building projects without the hassle of manual calculations.


## Features

1. **Doubloons Per Hour Calculation**
    - Dispays how many Doubloons you earned per hour for each project.
    - Adds the total number of votes received (not 100% accurate! :'<).

2. **Average Calculations**
   - Calculates the average Doubloons earned per hour across all projects.
   - Calculates the average Doubloons and votes across all projects.

3. **Prize Time Estimation** *(New Feature Coming Soon!)*
   - Select prizes, and the extension will calculate how much time you need to earn them based on your average Doubloons.
