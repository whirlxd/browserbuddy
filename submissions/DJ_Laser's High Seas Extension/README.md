[https://github.com/DJ-Laser/highseas-ext/releases/](https://github.com/DJ-Laser/highseas-ext/releases/)

Download the correct file for your browser and import it from the extension settings

## Build Manually

Use the included nix flake by running `nix develop`

Install packages with `npm i --force` (`--force` is needed because `@hackclub/icons` does officially not support react 19)

Build for chrome or firefox with `npm run build` or `npm run build-ff` respectively
